                <h2>What Is An Annuity?</h2>
                 <p>An annuity is a contractual agreement between you (the Annuitant) and an insurance 
     company in which you make a <span>lump-sum payment(s)</span> and, in return, receive <span>regular payouts</span>, 
     beginning either immediately or at some point in the future.</p><br>
     <p>The <span>payouts</span> continue as 
     a regular stream of income to the you as the annuitant and ceases in the event of your 
     unfortunate demise.</p>
     <br>
     <p> The <span>lump sum</span> one uses to purchase an annuity could come from your 
     accumulated savings during your active working years in investment solutions such as a 
     Personal Retirement Scheme.</p><br>
     <p>An <span>Annuity</span> is not to be confused with an <span>Income Draw Down</span>
     even though both are retirement income solutions.</p>

             <h2>What Types of Annuities Are Available at ICEA LION?</h2>
            <div class="article-row">
                <div class="article-text article-col">
              <p>There are different ways you can structure your annuities depending on your preference and circumstance, for 
example your <span>marital status</span>, the <span>amount</span> you would like your beneficiaries to receive in the unfortunate event of 
your demise amongst <span>other factors</span>.</p><br>
<p>The following is a description of the types of annuities we currently offer at ICEA LION:</p><br>
              <h3>1. Tax benefits</h3>
              <p>In a Deferred Annuity, you purchase an annuity but defer the start date of receiving pension.</p>
              <br>
              <p>This annuity type has 
two phases; the deferred phase in which there are no payouts and the annuity phase in which the plan is converted 
into regular payouts for life or a limited period.</p><br>
<p>At the expiry of the deferred period, the annuitant automatically 
begins to receive regular payments.</p>
<br>
<p>It is worth noting that, as the annuitant, you can change the beneficiaries and their designated allocations as you 
please.</p>
<br>

            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <p>Your named beneficiaries are entitled to the annuity funds where applicable in your unfortunate demise as 
the annuity contract owner (annuitant).</p>
<br>
                <h3>The advantages over immediate annuity are:</h3>
                <div class="text-align">
                    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Usually, your insurer guarantees a fixed rate of interest over the deferred period.</p><br>
                        <p>This assures you additional 
interest based on the initial investment over the deferred period and as a result, you end up with a higher 
amount per installment when you do start getting paid periodically.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="text-align">
                    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>As you advance in age during the deferred period, there will be a higher level of installment payments for the 
same purchase premium when you do start getting paid your annuity</p><br>
                    </div>
                </div>

                 <div class="text-align">
                    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>As the Annuity Owner, you can opt to top up the purchase price before the expiry of the deferred period by 
making further payments to the insurer. This will raise the level of your income installment payouts when they 
fall due.</p>

            <h3>2. Guaranteed Annuities</h3>
              <p>In a Guaranteed Annuity, you get to select a definite minimum period within which to receive the payouts, regardless 
of when you unfortunately pass on.</p><br>
<p> For example, an annuity guaranteed for ten years will be payable for 10 years 
or life, whichever is longer.</p><br>
<p>If you unfortunately pass on during the guaranteed period, then the balance of your 
guaranteed installments will be payable to your nominated beneficiaries. </p>
<br>
<p>The amount of annuity you can buy 
depends on the funds you have, your age and gender at the time of your purchase your annuity, annuity type as well 
as the Guarantee Period you select.</p>
<br>
              <h4 class="blue-color">The following are the major types of Guaranteed Annuities we offer at ICEA LION:</h4>
              <h4>2.1 Single Life Immediate Annuity</h4>
              <p>This solution provides, in return for your purchase price, regular payments 
starting immediately and continuing for the rest of your life.</p>
              <br>
              <p> This annuity covers only your life as an annuitant 
and not that of your spouse.</p>
<br>
<p> It is suitable for you if you wish to have income that is guaranteed to last for the 
rest of your life after retirement, no matter how long (or short) that may be.</p>
<br>

            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <h4>2.2 Joint Life and Last Survivor Annuity</h4>
                <p>This solution pays you a steady income for the joint lifetimes of two 
annuitants; yourself and for your spouse.</p>
<br>
<p>We recommend this as the most advisable option to provide you 
with retirement income as a married couple, since in the case of the Single Life Immediate Annuity mentioned 
above, payments cease if you as the principal annuitant unfortunately dies first, leaving your surviving spouse/
partner with no steady source of income.</p>
<br>
<p> Payments continue in full or part as agreed at the start date after 
the first unfortunate demise.</p>
<br>
<p> In the unfortunate event of the demise of both the annuitant and the spouse, 
before the expiry of the guarantee period, the balance of the guaranteed installments will be payable to the 
couples' nominated beneficiaries </p>
<br>
<p>The <span>main factors</span> considered in the purchase of a Joint Life and Last Survivor Annuity are the <span>ages</span> of the 
annuitant and spouse, the <span>guarantee period</span> and the <span>chosen reduction factor</span></p>

Survivor Annuity to give you the regular standard life annuity payments covered in both solutions as well as 
a refund of the annuity purchase price upon your unfortunate demise as the principal annuitant within a 
selected period. </p><br>
<p>  The refund is payable as a death benefit to your nominated beneficiaries.</p><br>
<p>At the point of buying the annuity with return of purchase price, you as the principal annuitant can choose

            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <p> <span>Reversionary Annuity</span> provides a steady income to you as the annuity 
owner and in the unfortunate event of your demise, the payments are changed to pay out to:</p>
<br>
<p><span>(a)</span> Widow/er's pension provided the spouse is still alive; and</p>
<br>
<p><span>(b)</span> Orphan's pension(s) also known as an Annuity Certain provided the named children have not attained 
the specified majority age of 23 years.</p>
<br>
<p>The resultant total payments to your spouse and children reduce by 
a predetermined factor, called the Reversionary Factor</p>
<br>
<p> For example, <span>your widow's</span> pension and <span>orphan's 
pension/Annuity</span> certain may be 50% and 20% of the initial total pension respectively.</p>
              <br>
              <p><span>NOTE:</span> If you as a couple and the named children/dependants unfortunately pass away before the expiry of the 
annuity's guarantee period, the guaranteed payments are made to the nominated beneficiaries. </p>
<br><p>The factors 
considered when purchasing this product are: age of the spouses/couple, guarantee period, current age of the 
children and the orphan's pension/cessation age of the children/children's annuity certain.</p>

           <h3>3. Temporary Annuities</h3>
              <p>With this solution, the payments to you cease upon the occurrence of certain named events in your life, other than 
your unfortunate demise; for example, re-marriage or attainment of a certain age or expiry of a specified term.</p><br>
<h4 class="blue-color">The following types of Temporary Annuities are available at ICEA LION:</h4>
<h4>3.1 Annuity Certain</h4>
<p>This product secures payment for a specified period regardless of whether you as the 
annuitant are alive or not. In the unfortunate event of your demise before the expiry of the specified period, 
the periodical payments continue to be made to your nominated beneficiary(ies). </p><br>
<p> It is important to note that 
due to increased life expectancy, this option may not be appropriate for you as a retiree as you may live longer 
that the selected period. </p>
<br>
<p>The main factor considered in when purchasing the Annuity Certain is the term (period) of the annuity 
contract.</p>
<br>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <h4>3.2 Widow / Widower's Pension:</h4>
                <p> This ensures that your widow/widower continues to receive the periodical 
payments after your unfortunately pass on; until they re-marry or in the unfortunate event of their demise, 
whichever happens earlier.</p>
<br>
<p>The main factors considered in the purchase of this product are the gender and age of the widow/widower.</p>
<br>
<p>Recent changes in the annuity market have resulted in most pension schemes adopting this as a necessary 
recommendation in their Trust Deeds and Rules, thereby providing for the purchase of a single life immediate 
annuity for your window/widower.</p>
<br>
<h4>3.3 Orphan's Pension</h4>
<p>This provides periodical payments to your orphans and only cease on attainment of a 
certain pre-agreed age or earlier, in the unfortunate event of the demise of the orphan. When considering the 
best options to financially support your orphans, it is better to take an Annuity Certain with payments ceasing 
on attainment of a specified majority age.</p>
<br>
<p>The main factor considered in buying this product is the number of years to the age at which payments will 
cease.</p>
