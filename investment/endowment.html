                 <h2>What Is An Endowment?</h2>
                  <p>An Anticipated Endowment is an insurance policy 
that gives you a platform to grow your savings 
by making regular payments <span>(premiums)</span> over a 
specified period of time.</p>
<br>
<p>An Anticipated Endowment 
policy is suitable for anyone who wants to save up 
for a long-term goal, but still wants to enjoy interim 
rewards to take care of short term goals.</p>
<br>
<p>Anticipated Endowment policies give you a set 
number of payouts over the duration of the policy</p>
<br>
<p>It is also important to note that an Anticipated 
Endowment policy is essentially a life insurance 
policy, which means that the <span>Sum Assured</span> and 
<span>bonuses</span> (both of which combined are known as 
<span>maturity benefits</span>) are payable to your <span>nominated 
beneficiaries</span> in the unfortunate event of your 
demise.</p>
<br>
<p>Endowments grow your savings because 
the potential bonuses you gain are derived from 
the interest accrued from the investments made on 
your behalf by the insurer.</p>

                 <h2>What Is endowment with profits</h2>
               <p>An Endowment With Profits policy is insurance that 
   gives you a platform to grow your savings by making 
   regular payments (premiums) over a specified 
   period of time.</p><br>
   <p> An Endowment With Profits policy is 
   suitable for anyone who wants to save up for a long-term goal and wishes to have a disciplined way to do 
   so.</p>
   <br>
   <p>An Endowment With Profits policy pays you a lump 
   sum at the end of the term of the policy. There are 
   no partial payments during the course of your policy 
   term.</p>
   <br>
   <p> It is also important to note that an Endowment 
With Profits policy is essentially life insurance, which 
means that the <span>Sum Assured</span> and <span>bonuses</span> (both of 
which combined are known as <span>maturity benefits</span>) 
are payable to your <span>nominated beneficiaries</span> in the

            <h2>What Are The Key Benefits Of Our ICEA LION Anticipated Endowment &
Endowment With Profits Policy?</h2>
            <div class="article-row">
             <div class="article-text article-col">
              <h3>Payout in 3 installments (Anticipated Endowment):</h3>
              <p>The frequency and percentages that are paid out with each installment in an <span>Anticipated 
Endowment</span> vary from company to company.</p>
<br>
<p>At ICEA LION, the first payout is 20% of the Sum Assured, the second 
payout is 20% of the Sum Assured and the final payout at maturity is 60% of the Sum Assured plus the accrued 
bonuses.</p>
<br>
<p>However, it is important to note that the amount that is guaranteed to be paid out is your Sum Assured. 
The bonuses are paid out subject to market performance during the duration of your policy.</p>
<br>
              <h3>Eligibility for full Sum Assured Payout is immediate:</h3>
              <p>A very special feature of both policies is 
that once our contractual agreements are finalized 
(including payment of your first premium installment), 
in the unfortunate event of your demise, we will pay out 
the full Sum Assured to your nominated beneficiaries 
immediately.</p><br>
<p>You should however note that we will 
deduct the amount commensurate with what you 
would have paid for as a full year's premium - from the 
final dues - if you had not paid up for the full first year</p>
<br>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <h3>Flexible payment options:</h3>
<p>You can opt to pay 
premiums monthly, quarterly or annually which is 
suitable for self-employed as well as salaried employees.</p>
<br>
                <h3>You can add on additional benefits (Riders):</h3>
                <p>At 
a minimal additional fee, you can boost your policy 
with a rider to your existing policy.</p>
<br>
<p>These include:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>disability rider</li>
    <li>accidental death</li>
    <li>waiver of premium for unfortunate events such as loss of income</li>
    <li>critical 
illness</li>
    <li>last expense (funeral benefit)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>This can be 
done at any stage of the policy; it does not have to be 
done at inception. </p>

             <h3>Contribution Break (Re-Dating):</h3>
             <p> If you are unable to 
continue paying the premiums for your policy, you can 
pause payment of your policy and restart when your 
circumstances improve, at no extra cost.</p>
<br>
<p>This is known 
as re-dating. Other organizations may charge a fee on 
the arrears, however we do not charge at ICEA LION. 
You can however only re-date once.</p>
<br>
<h3>Policy Loan:</h3>
<p> You can take a loan against your premiums 
from year 3 (36 months of contributions) and the loan 
amount is dependent on the value of your policy at that 
time not the Sum Assured.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Tax-Free benefit:</h3>
<p>When your policy matures, you will 
get the full Sum Assured paid to you Tax-Free.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <h3>15% tax relief:</h3>
                <p>If you are employed and you advise 
your HR department about your policy, you get a 15% 
tax relief each month.</p>
<br><p><span>NOTE:</span> If you are self-employed you can 
claim the same from Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA).</p>
<br>
<h3>Guarantee Income for Your Loved Ones:</h3>
<p>In the 
unfortunate event of your demise, your nominated 
beneficiaries can still have the quality of life you 
envisioned for them.</p>
<br>
<p> That said, it is very important that 
you ensure you have structures in place to ensure that 
the people who are left in control of your funds use it 
as you desired.</p>
<br>
<p><span>NOTE:</span> In order to protect your legacy for your 
intended purposes, it would be advisable to consider 
Estate Planning and perhaps set up a Trust.</p>

            <h2>What Happens If I Cannot Pay My Premium?</h2>
            <p>Life Happens! If for one reason or another you are unable to pay your premiums, you can opt for either of these 
options:</p>
            <div class="article-row">
            <div class="article-text article-col">
               <h3>Take a Contribution Break (Re-Dating):</h3>
               <p> As mentioned above, you have the option to Re-Date your policy and you 
can resume your payments once your circumstances improve. The policy period will be revised to suit your new 
circumstances.</p><br>
<h3>Reduce Your Premium:</h3>
<p> You have the option to reduce the premiums you pay to a minimum of Kes 2,000 per month 
and keep the policy active. This will result in either a reduced maturity amount (if you stick to the original policy 
duration) or an extended policy duration.</p>
<br>
<h3>Accept an Automatic Premium Loan:</h3>
<p> ICEA LION will deduct the amount of outstanding premium from the maturity 
value of the policy which will have been given to you in form of a loan as monthly premium.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <p>After 3 months of non-payment, we automatically take up this loan on your behalf, referred to as an Automatic Premium Loan (APL), in 
order to keep your policy active.</p><br>
                <p> This can remain in effect for several years, so it is important to engage us your 
options as this facility erodes the final dues paid to you at the end of contract. This facility only applies if you have 
been saving for over 3 years (36 months).</p>
<br>
<h3>Surrender The Policy after 3 Years:</h3>
<p>If you have paid up for more than 3 years (36 months), your policy will have 
attained what is called surrender value and you will be able to terminate your policy.</p>
<br>
<p> However, you should note that 
due to the fact that your funds had been invested in a longer term financial instrument and you are pulling out and 
also because funds have been utilizing in servicing the policy, you will be paid an amount that is potentially less than 
what you have contributed.</p>
