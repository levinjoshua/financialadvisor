                <p>An education insurance policy is a type of life insurance that allows you to save towards 
    your child's education.</p><br>
    <p>The plan enables you to set aside a given amount every so often; 
    monthly, quarterly or annually for a specified period of time so that you have sufficient 
    funds to invest in the quality of education you desire for your child.</p>
    <br>
    <p>An education insurance policy also has a protection component that pays out the amount 
    you intend to your nominated beneficiaries in the unfortunate event of your demise, so 
    that the education dreams you have for them continue uninterrupted. At ICEA LION, we 
    refer to this product as UsomiBora.</p>

                  <p>The term endowment is tossed around quite a bit, yet it is unclear to most people what it 
      actually means! </p><br>
      <p>Despite the complicated name, an endowment is a type of life insurance 
      where you make monthly or periodical payments and you get a guaranteed payout after a 
      specified period of time, i.e. when the policy matures or in the unfortunate event of your 
      demise. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Some endowments even pay out in the unfortunate event of your incapacitation 
      or if you are diagnosed with a critical illness. Typical maturity periods for endowments are 
      ten, fifteen or twenty years, up to a certain age limit.</p>

     <p><span>Protection for Your Loved Ones:</span> In the unfortunate event of your passing, the plan offers 
     financial security to your family, safeguarding them against potential loss of income and 
     wealth. This prevents them from having to sell assets to make ends meet.</p>
     <br>
     <p><span>Coverage for You:</span> The plan also provides financial support in case you suffer from a disability
     or a specified illness. Additionally, the Whole of Life Plan serves as a valuable asset, similar to land, property, or
     stocks. It can be passed on to your loved ones as part of your estate, ensuring that the lump 
     sum is paid directly to your beneficiaries.</p>

Term Assurance</h2>
                  <p>Insurance terms may sound complicated and “Term Assurance” is no different. Simply put, 
                  term assurance refers to a type of insurance that covers you for a specified number of 
                  years also known as the “term”.</p><br>
                  <p>The primary purpose of a term assurance is to insure your 
                  life, so that in the unfortunate event of your demise, your loved ones receive a payout.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>This 
                  payout is known as the Sum Assured and will be paid to your nominated beneficiaries (if 
                  your policy is active or in force) immediately following notification of your demise, not at 
                  the end of the term of the policy. You are at liberty to decide on the number of years you 
                  wish to be covered for and how frequently you wish to make the payments; either monthly, 
                  quarterly or annually. </p>
