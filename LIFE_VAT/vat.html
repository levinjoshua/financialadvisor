                <h2>What Is a Value Added
Term Assurance</h2>
                  <p>Insurance terms may sound complicated and “Term Assurance” is no different. Simply put, 
                  term assurance refers to a type of insurance that covers you for a specified number of 
                  years also known as the “term”.</p><br>
                  <p>The primary purpose of a term assurance is to insure your 
                  life, so that in the unfortunate event of your demise, your loved ones receive a payout.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>This 
                  payout is known as the Sum Assured and will be paid to your nominated beneficiaries (if 
                  your policy is active or in force) immediately following notification of your demise, not at 
                  the end of the term of the policy. You are at liberty to decide on the number of years you 
                  wish to be covered for and how frequently you wish to make the payments; either monthly, 
                  quarterly or annually. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>A term assurance is different from an endowment with the difference being that endowments 
pay you interest (or bonus) either during or at the end of the duration of the policy. </p>
<br>
<p> As a 
result, at the of your policy period, your maturity benefits consist of both the sum assured 
and the accrued bonuses. Further, the sums assured for term assurances are usually much 
higher than that of endowments.</p>

            <h2>What Is ICEA LION's 
Value Added Term 
Assurance?</h2>
            <div class="article-row">
                <div class="article-text article-col">
                <P>Our Value Added Term assurance, initiated by ICEA 
LION in the East African insurance market, is unique 
in that it allows you to save for your desired term and 
get back your full premium contributions at the end 
of that period.</P><br>
<p> However, in the unfortunate event of 
your demise, we will pay your nominated beneficiaries 
the Sum Assured immediately following notification 
of your demise.</p>
<br>
<p> It is very important to note that if 
you are alive once the policy term ends, you will 
be reimbursed your full premium contributions, 
however, you will not receive the Sum Assured.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
              <p>We also offer Level Term Assurance, with the 
difference being that the payout for a Level Term 
Assurance is higher than that of Value Added Term 
Assurance. Further, Level Term Assurance does not 
refund your premium contributions at the end of 
the policy period, even if you are alive at the end of 
the term.</p>

            <h2>What Are The Key Benefits Of Our ICEA LION Value 
Added Term Assurance?</h2>
            <div class="article-row">
                <div class="article-text article-col">
                <h3>Eligibility for full Sum Assured Payout is immediate:</h3>
                <p>Once our contractual agreements are finalized 
(including payment of your first premium installment), 
in the unfortunate event of your demise, we will pay out 
the full Sum Assured to your nominated beneficiaries 
immediately upon notification of your demise.</p><br>
<p> You 
should however note that we will deduct the amount 
commensurate with what you would have paid for as a 
full year's premium - from the final dues - if you had not 
paid up for the full first year.</p><br>
<h3>Affordability:</h3>
<p>In the unfortunate event you lose your 
source of income, you can reduce your premium 
payments up to Kes 2,000 and you can later revise 
them upwards when your circumstances improve.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <h3>Flexible payment options:</h3>
<p>You can opt to pay 
premiums monthly, quarterly or annually which is 
suitable for self-employed as well as salaried employees.</p><br>
<h3>Contribution Break (Re-Dating):</h3>
<p> If you are unable to 
continue paying the premiums for your policy, you can 
pause payment of your policy and restart when your 
circumstances improve, at no extra cost.</p><br>
<p> This is known 
as re-dating. Other organizations may charge a fee on 
the arrears, however we do not charge at ICEA LION. 
You can however only re-date once.</p>

              <h3>Policy Loan:</h3>
              <p> You can take a loan against your premiums 
from year 3 (36 months of contributions) and the loan 
amount is dependent on the value of your policy at that 
time not the Sum Assured.</p><br>
<h3>Tax-Free benefit:</h3>
<p>When your policy matures, you will 
get the full Sum Assured paid to you Tax-Free.</p>
<h3>15% tax relief </h3>
<p>If you are employed and you advise your HR department 
about your policy, you get a 15% tax relief each month. 
If you are self-employed you can claim the same from 
Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA).</p>

                <p>In the 
unfortunate event of your demise, your nominated 
beneficiaries can still have the quality of life you 
envisioned for them.</p><br>
              <p> That said, it is very important that 
you ensure you have structures in place to ensure that 
the people who are left in control of your funds use it 
as you desired.</p><br>
<p> In order to protect your legacy for your 
intended purposes, it would be advisable to consider 
Estate Planning and perhaps set up a Trust.</p>

            <h2>What Happens If I Cannot Pay My Premium?</h2>
            <p>Life Happens! If for one reason or another you are unable to pay your premiums, you can opt for either of these 
options:</p>
            <div class="article-row">
                <div class="article-text article-col">
              <h3>Take a Contribution Break (Re-Dating): </h3>
              <p>As mentioned above, you have the option to Re-Date your policy and you 
can resume your payments once your circumstances improve. The policy period will be revised to suit your new 
circumstances.</p><br>
<h3>Reduce Your Premium:</h3>
<p> You have the option to reduce the premiums you pay to a minimum of Kes 2,000 per month 
and keep the policy active. This will result in either a reduced maturity amount (if you stick to the original policy 
duration) or an extended policy duration.</p>
<br>

            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
                <h3>Accept an Automatic Premium Loan: </h3>
<p>ICEA LION will deduct the amount of outstanding premium from the maturity 
value of the policy which will have been given to you in form of a loan as monthly premium.</p><br>
                <p>After 3 months of non-payment, we automatically take up this loan on your behalf, referred to as an Automatic Premium Loan (APL), in 
order to keep your policy active.</p><br>
              <p>This can remain in effect for several years, so it is important to engage us your 
options as this facility erodes the final dues paid to you at the end of contract. This facility only applies if you have 
been saving for over 3 years (36 months).</p><br>
