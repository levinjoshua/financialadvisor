                <h2>What Is A Money Market Fund?</h2>
               <p>A Money Market Fund is a type of a Unit Trust. A Unit Trust is a type of investment where 
people with common savings and investment goals join a collective investment scheme 
that is managed by a professional investment/fund manager.</p><br>
<p>The key advantage of this 
arrangement is that all investors, big or small benefit from the economies of scale the 
pooled funds provide. In Kenya, Unit Trusts are regulated by the Capital Markets Authority 
(CMA).</p>
<br>
<p>A Money Market Fund is a low-risk investment with an element of guaranteed return. These 
investments mainly include interest-bearing assets like fixed deposits, treasury bills, short-term bonds and so on. </p>
<br>
<p>The Money Market Fund is suitable for you as a saver or investor 
if you are seeking liquidity (the ability to access your funds easily), monthly income in the 
form of interest added onto your original deposit (capital) and subsequent deposits, or if 
you are looking to preserve your capital.</p>
<br>
<p>As with any Unit Trust, you can access your funds 
at any time.</p><br>
                <p> A Money Market Fund is considered the least risky fund, of all unit trusts, 
because you never lose your invested capital.  However, you should note that the interest 
rate (yield) varies day to day depending on market performance.</p>

            <h2>So What Are The Benefits 
Of Our ICEA LION Money 
Market Fund?</h2>
            <div class="article-row">
                <div class="article-text article-col">
<h3>1. Affordability</h3>
<p>At ICEA LION, you can set up your Money Market 
for as little as Kes 500 and top up with whatever 
amount you wish to save or invest at any time.</p>
<br>
<p>There is no minimum top up amount nor do we 
charge any withdrawal fees.</p>
<br>
<p>The interest or yield 
on your account is accrued on daily account 
balance.</p>
<br>
<p> You can set this up at your convenience 
by visiting our DigiTrust Page that allows you to 
plan for, set up and deposit your funds at the 
click of a button.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
             <h3>2. Ease of Access to Funds</h3>
             <p>Also known as Liquidity, Unit Trust Funds offer you 
the opportunity to access your funds easily.</p>
<br>
<p> There 
are no fixed periods per se so you can access your 
money whenever you need it in part or as a whole, 
with no penalties.</p>
<br>
<p>At ICEA LION, for amounts less 
than Kes 10,000 via mobile money, you can access 
your funds under 24 hours, whilst those above Kes 
10,000 can be sent to your bank account within 3 
working days.</p>

                <div class="article-text article-col">
<h3>3. Transparency & Governance</h3>
<p>Unit Trusts are created by what is called a deed.</p>
<br>
<p>A deed constitutes a contractual agreement that 
governs the relationship between you, the investor, 
the investment/fund manager, the trustees and 
Capital Markets Authority, who supervise and ensure 
the integrity of the investment plan for Unit Trusts. 
As a result, the investors rights are protected.</p>

             <h3>4. Save For Multiple Goals Using One Platform</h3>
             <p>You can save for your different goals using one 
platform via our DigiTrust portal and track all your 
progress under one dashboard.</p>

            <h3>5. Economies of Scale</h3>
            <p>The fact that your investment is pooled with 
others, gives you access to investments that would 
otherwise be unaffordable or inaccessible to you as 
an individual investor. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
            <h3>6. Professional Investment Management</h3>

experienced professionals who advise and guide you 
throughout your investment journey based on your 
goals, risk profile and your current financial position.</p>

            <h3>7. Diversification of Investments</h3>
            <p>Unit Trusts take advantage of the pooled funds 
to give individual investors access to a variety of 
investment instruments. </p>
<br>
<p>The economies of scale 
offer the opportunity for investment in diverse 
portfolios which you would otherwise not be able to 
enjoy as an individual. </p>
<br>
<p>Further, the diversified range 
of assets reduces the risk you would face if you 
directly invested in only one asset class.</p>

        considered the least risky fund

        never lose your invested capital.</p>

                    <p>In Kenya, there are four main types of Unit Trust Funds which we all offer at ICEA LION:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Money Market Fund</li>
    <li>Equity Fund</li>
    <li>Growth Fund also know as Balanced Fund</li>

            <h3>What Can You Tell Me About ICEA LION Unit Trust 
Funds & Their Risk Levels?</h3>
<p>How you select a Unit Trust Fund is dependent on your individual saving and investment objectives as well as 
your risk appetite.</p>

Funds we have at ICEA LION with their corresponding risk levels.</p>

              <h3>1. Equity Fund</h3>    
              <p>This fund invests mainly in listed companies on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). The Equity Fund is 
suitable for savers and investors seeking long-term capital growth.</p>
<br>
<p><span>Risk Level - Medium to High:</span> This is because the interest to be earned is subject to market forces, so there are 
no guarantees on return due to the fact that the fund value varies day to day, based on market performance. </p>
<br>
<p>An investor may therefore reap great rewards or suffer loss depending on when one withdraws their funds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-text article-col">
            <h3>2. Growth (Balanced) Fund</h3>
            <p>This fund invests mainly in listed companies on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) as well as investment 
instruments that allow you to gain interest on your investment such as in fixed deposits and bonds.</p>
<br>
<p>The 
Growth / Balanced Fund is suitable for savers and investors seeking a balanced portfolio between liquidity 
(the ability to access your funds easily) and growing your capital.</p>
<br>
<p><span>Risk Level - Medium:</span> This is a less risky fund than the Equity and Bond Fund because your capital is invested 
in both secure and interest earning investments that vary subject to market forces. As such, with this fund, 
the probability of loss of your capital is reduced.</p>

            <p>The Money 
Market Fund is suitable for savers and investors seeking liquidity (the ability to access your funds easily),

            <p>This fund invests mainly in a diversified portfolio of treasury and corporate bonds. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Bond Fund is suitable 
for savers and investors seeking to put their money in a diversified portfolio of bonds that offer regular or 
periodical income.</p>
<br>
<p><span>Risk Level - Medium to High:</span>  This is because the interest to be earned is subject to market forces, so there are 
no guarantees on return due to the fact that the fund value varies day to day, based on market performance.

                  <h3>Management Fee</h3>
            <p>It is important to note that a management fee is 
applied to your account balance daily (0.0055% 
per day or equivalent to 2% per annum).</p>
<br>
<p>This is 
due to the fact that the interest rate changes 
daily based on market performance and because 
you have the liberty to withdraw your funds at 
any time.</p>
<br>
<p>This way, you are not charged an annual 
amount, rather we apply a charge day on day 
based on what amount is in your fund that day. </p>
