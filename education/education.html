                <h2>What Is Education Insurance?</h2>
                <p>An education insurance policy is a type of life insurance that allows you to save towards 
                your child's education.</p><br>
                <p>The plan enables you to set aside a given amount every so often; 
                monthly, quarterly or annually for a specified period of time so that you have sufficient 
                funds to invest in the quality of education you desire for your child.</p>
                <br>
                <p>An education insurance policy also has a protection component that pays out the amount 
                you intend to your nominated beneficiaries in the unfortunate event of your demise, so 
                that the education dreams you have for them continue uninterrupted. At ICEA LION, we 
                refer to this product as UsomiBora.</p>

                <h3>Income Diversification</h3>
                <p>It allows the parent to diversify their income in other areas of investment since
there is surety of school fees.</p><br>

              <p>In the unfortunate event of your demise, your child 
can still have the quality of education you envisioned 
for them. </p><br>
<p>That said, it is very important that you 
ensure you have structures in place to ensure that the 
people who are left in control of your funds use it as 
you desired.</p><br>
<p>In order to protect your legacy for your 
intended purposes, it would be advisable to consider 
Estate Planning and perhaps set up a Trust. </p>
<br>
<h3>Secures sense of peace</h3>
<p>The policy is a modern way of creating peace of mind for future school fees like
the old way of keeping livestock.</p>
